🧩 Problem: Majority Element

Problem Number: 169 (LeetCode)

📄 Problem Statement

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times.
You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

🧠 Approach (Boyer–Moore Voting Algorithm)
🔑 Idea:
Maintain a candidate and a count
If count becomes 0, choose a new candidate
Increase count if same element
Decrease count if different element

👉 Majority element will always survive due to its higher frequency

⏱️ Complexity
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)

class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums):
        count = 0
        candidate = None

        for num in nums:
            if count == 0:
                candidate = num
            
            if num == candidate:
                count += 1
            else:
                count -= 1

        return candidate
